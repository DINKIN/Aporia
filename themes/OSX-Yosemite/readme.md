# OSX-Yosemite

This theme is used on Mac OS X. It is based on
[OSX-Yosemite](http://dgk15.deviantart.com/art/OS-X-Yosemite-theme-0-2-for-Ubuntu-14-04-472626539).

Based on this theme's original header comment, it is based on Bridge
by ScionicSpectre. A theme which is LGPL licensed, as such I will assume that
the license of the modification is the same:
http://scionicspectre.deviantart.com/art/Bridge-Adwaita-3-x-GTK-2-Port-304340129.
Pretty sure LGPL forces the license to remain the same.
